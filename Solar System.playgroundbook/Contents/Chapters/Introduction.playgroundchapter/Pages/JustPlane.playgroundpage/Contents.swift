## Solar System Plane

Well, it is observed that solar system are actually very planar, i.e. planets and sun do not just randomly orbit in any direction. We'll be looking at how to construct your Solar System plane in this page

**Goal:** Locating plane for Solar System

1. Run the code on right and go into full-screen mode
2. Locate a horizontal flat surface (like your tabletop or floor). This would be your solar plane.
3. Keep moving your iPad's camera to add more area to your solar system! Remember, planets are big and you need a big area ;)
4. As you locate, the live camera would start placing grid indicating the area you "own" for your solar system
5. That's it for this exercise!

Let's go!
